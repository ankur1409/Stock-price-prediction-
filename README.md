The code loads stock price data for various companies, specifically focusing on Apple (AAPL), and visualizes the stock's historical closing prices and trading volumes. It preprocesses the data, trains an LSTM model to predict future closing prices, and then evaluates the model's performance by plotting the actual vs. predicted prices and calculating error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
